# Runtime behavior

There are two separate decisions: cloud-binding dispatch selects local or remote
request execution; `prefer` selects a local JavaScript environment. A local
Dedicated Web Worker runs on the device, not on Cloudflare.

## Fetch-only integration

For an existing frontend calling Worker APIs, configure the Worker in the [Capacitor build](build-setup.md) and omit `render`. Initialize before mounting the UI:

```ts
import { workersCapacitor } from "cf-workers-native/capacitor";

const runtime = workersCapacitor({
  baseURL: "https://api.example.com/api/",
});
await runtime.ready;

const response = await fetch("/api/hello");
```

The existing UI keeps its ordinary Fetch calls. Matching requests use the configured local or remote Worker; requests outside the boundary keep their normal Fetch behavior. For cloud-dependent routes, configure the bindings and remote origin using the [integration guide](integration.md).

## Execution preference

The default `prefer: "worker"` starts a Dedicated Web Worker when available and the initial `env` contains only plain data. If Worker is absent, its constructor reports SecurityError/NotSupportedError, or `env` contains methods/custom prototypes/accessors (such as local KV bindings), it selects direct execution before handling any request. `prefer: "direct"` loads the direct module without creating a Worker. Direct execution is always the available baseline; a module or application error does not mean it is unavailable.

Await `runtime.ready` and inspect `runtime.execution` (`"worker"` or `"direct"`) to observe the selection. Direct code is dynamically imported only when selected. Selection happens once: startup script failures and request errors are reported, never replayed in the other environment. This is not automatic detection of every unsupported Workers API. Changes to `env` after selection do not trigger reselection. Worker selection conservatively accepts primitives, ordinary objects and arrays (including cycles), without non-enumerable custom properties or null prototypes; other structured-clone-capable types currently select direct too.

## Initialization and cleanup

Installation synchronously intercepts fetch. Worker-mode requests wait for startup; matching requests during direct-module loading reject explicitly to prevent top-level-await deadlocks. Await `runtime.ready` before starting UI requests. The runtime cannot distinguish module-initialization calls from concurrent UI calls, so both reject while direct loading is in progress. `await runtime.ready` observes startup success/failure before rendering the UI. `await workersCapacitor(...)` does **not** await Worker startup.

Only one installation is supported; `await runtime.dispose()` restores fetch, terminates the Dedicated Worker and waits for asynchronous cleanup when needed. Termination rejects unfinished local calls/body reads and releases background tracking.

## Explicit Worker sources

Explicit direct-handler imports and standard `new Worker(new URL(...), { type: "module" })` factories are supported. `prefer` requires the plugin configuration or an explicit source with both `createWorker` and `loadDirect`; it cannot manufacture a second candidate from a handler or factory alone.

Direct imports remain supported: `import worker from "./worker"` supplies an object with `fetch` and runs in the UI global scope. Hono needs no build plugin in that mode; Workers Express still needs the compatibility plugin. Worker subrequests stay outside UI interception only when `runtime.execution` is `"worker"`; direct fallback shares the UI global environment.

If the Worker or any dependency uses Workers extensions (for example
`Headers.getAll("set-cookie")` or `Request.cf`) during module evaluation, configure
`worker` in the Vite/esbuild plugin as shown in the [build setup guide](build-setup.md). The runtime installs its Web
APIs before loading that entry and its dependencies, in both execution modes.
With a direct static import, module evaluation happens before `workersCapacitor()`
can initialize those APIs; only calls made after initialization use the installed
implementations. For plain JavaScript, use the [`loadDirect` source](build-setup.md#browser-es-modules-no-bundler)
when initialization must precede module evaluation.

## URL contract

### How local requests are selected

The adapter resolves the request URL, then checks both its address and path:

1. The URL must match either the running app's **protocol and host** (including the port), or the origin configured in `baseURL`.
2. Its path must equal the `baseURL` path boundary or be below it. For `/api/`, `/api` and `/api/hello` match; `/apiary` does not.

Matching requests normally run in the local Worker. With cloud-binding build integration, the generated selector can send them to the existing deployed Worker before local execution. The adapter replaces the origin with the `baseURL` origin while preserving the path and query. The protocol alone does not select local execution: `capacitor://other-host/api/hello` does not match an app running at `capacitor://localhost`.

With default Capacitor settings, `fetch("/api/hello")` follows these paths (assuming no `<base>` override and `baseURL: "https://api.example.com/api/"`):

| Platform | Resolved app request URL          | URL received by the local Worker    |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| iOS      | `capacitor://localhost/api/hello` | `https://api.example.com/api/hello` |
| Android  | `https://localhost/api/hello`     | `https://api.example.com/api/hello` |

The adapter uses the running app's URL, so custom scheme/hostname settings are handled by the same comparison. Without a generated remote boundary these are local JavaScript calls; neither row sends an HTTP request to `api.example.com`. Requests selected for remote execution instead use `remote.origin`, defaulting to the `baseURL` origin when omitted. Remote options such as `getToken` can be supplied without an origin. Explicit overrides must be valid HTTPS origins and never fall back on validation failure.

### Endpoint examples

For `baseURL: "https://api.example.com/api/"` and an app served at `https://localhost/` (without a `<base>` override):

| URL passed to `fetch()`             | Request endpoint                           | Handled by     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `/api/hello?name=A`                 | `https://api.example.com/api/hello?name=A` | Local Worker   |
| `https://api.example.com/api/hello` | `https://api.example.com/api/hello`        | Local Worker   |
| `/api`                              | `https://api.example.com/api`              | Local Worker   |
| `/apiary`                           | `https://localhost/apiary`                 | Original fetch |
| `/outside.txt`                      | `https://localhost/outside.txt`            | Original fetch |
| `https://other.example/api/hello`   | `https://other.example/api/hello`          | Original fetch |

For local execution, the endpoint is the URL received by the Worker's Fetch Handler; no HTTP request is sent to that server.

The path in `baseURL` selects a boundary; it is **not appended** to request paths. Relative paths resolve against `document.baseURI` (including `<base href>`) first, falling back to location when no document exists. Same-app URLs (including iOS `capacitor://localhost`) in the boundary are remapped to the base origin. Set a root base URL only if you intend to intercept every same-app fetch. A local 404/500 or exception never retries against the network. In Fetch-only mode, this fetch adapter does not intercept UI navigation, XHR, images or other WebViews. With `render`, a separate [native document bridge](native-rendering-api.md) handles supported document navigation, forms and resource requests.

## Compatibility and limitations

### Verified API behavior

- Covered: Hono and Workers Express GET/POST/HEAD, query and route params, JSON bodies, middleware, 404/500, concurrent requests, Request input, logical URLs.
- Optional `env` injects caller-provided values into the fetch handler's second argument. In isolated mode it is cloned per call: functions/native plugin objects cannot be passed and object identity is not preserved. No Wrangler secret values or cloud binding objects are imported; the build plugins read binding configuration to choose local or remote execution. `cloudflare:workers` named `env` is a partial adapter: the isolated transport updates a realm-wide proxy before dispatch, but direct execution does not populate it and module initialization happens before the first dispatch. Use the handler’s `env` argument for portable access; the proxy does not provide request-local isolation.
- `ctx.waitUntil()` tracks promises without delaying the response; `runtime.drain()` waits for them. Errors go to optional `onBackgroundError` (default: console). OS suspension/termination can stop pending work.
- Fetch abort rejects the caller and propagates a signal. It cannot forcibly stop arbitrary application work. Cookies, redirect following, `Response.url` population, credentials/cache policies and CORS enforcement are not emulated for local calls.

See [compatibility and limitations](compatibility.md) for incomplete Node
modules, Workers APIs, cloud services and native transport restrictions.
The [application integration limits](compatibility.md#application-integration-limits)
also cover Better Auth on iOS, passkeys, external-browser OAuth, Void routing,
live analytics and the boundary between simulator checks and physical devices.

### Framework and platform limits

- Workers HTTP request/response streaming and native TCP are covered by shared contracts. File serving, WebSockets, other Node modules and async context propagation require their own compatibility work; the inventory records their status. The compatibility layer is not a general Node runtime.
- `passThroughOnException`, WorkerEntrypoint/RPC and Service Worker format are unsupported. Workers-specific Request fields are covered only where stated in the compatibility inventory; `Request.cf` is preserved locally and is not populated with Cloudflare network metadata. Worker evaluation must not fetch its own local endpoints before installation.
- CapacitorHttp's fetch patch is not tested; leave it disabled for this Preview. The package includes native TCP/TLS transport and document integration sources (iOS SPM / Android Gradle). A plain browser uses browser Fetch; native document rendering requires Capacitor.

### Security and network boundaries

- Treat everything packaged in the app as readable by users. Do not embed database credentials, service tokens or other server secrets.
- For detected remote execution boundaries, the build removes server implementations, including their SQL, from the client bundle. This is not a general secret scanner: inspect the generated build report and bundled assets before shipping.
- Authenticate and authorize requests on the deployed Worker. `remote.getToken` can supply existing bearer credentials, and native rendering supports server-managed Cookie sessions; the library does not provide an authentication system. A URL configured in `remote.origin` does not protect the endpoint.
- Worker-generated HTML runs with the app's Capacitor plugin access. Only render trusted application content; do not use this integration to display arbitrary external pages.

See the [integration security guidance](integration.md) for the client/server boundary and migration checks.

With a direct Worker import, matching Worker subrequests can re-enter the UI handler. In Capacitor, outbound HTTP(S) uses the packaged native transport, including when relayed from a Dedicated Worker. This transport handles headers, redirects and response bytes outside browser CORS enforcement. In a plain browser, outbound requests use browser Fetch and remain subject to its CORS and header restrictions. Neither execution mode is a workerd isolate.

### Worker transport and resource lifetime

The isolated transport streams uploads and responses as pull-driven MessagePort chunks (uploads are split at 64 KiB). Upload handlers can run before EOF; cancellation releases the upload reader. It preserves status/statusText/headers, body cancellation, abort after headers and background completion. Invalid/used/locked responses and status-0 opaque/error responses reject. Errors retain name/message, not identity/stack; custom abort/cancel reasons are not transported to the Worker. Unconsumed response bodies retain resources until consumed, cancelled or disposed. `drain()` tracks background work, not body consumption.

## Execution environment and async context

The original Worker handler remains the Cloudflare entry. Install the Vite/esbuild
plugin only in the Capacitor/browser build: its aliases select the local API
implementations; the Cloudflare build retains native `node:*` and `cloudflare:*`.
`getExecutionEnvironment()` (also available from `cf-workers-native/environment`)
distinguishes Cloudflare Workers, native Capacitor hosts, browser workers, browsers,
and unknown realms. A browser Dedicated Worker is not Cloudflare Workers.
Installing the Capacitor runtime in Cloudflare Workers fails before changing globals.

Capacitor builds lower async functions and generators, preserving module-level
`await`, so AsyncLocalStorage scopes restore immediately and Promise continuations
retain their own stores. Application handlers need no edits. Native async callbacks
created outside this build pipeline (for example with `eval`) are rejected as ALS
scope callbacks. Cloudflare continues to use its native async context implementation.

Document responses are fetched incrementally on iOS and Android. Native document
uploads still cross a buffered boundary and reject above 8 MiB before concatenation;
use the Fetch-only runtime for streaming uploads. LocalStorage KV stream reads decode
bounded chunks lazily, but the storage API itself necessarily returns a complete
encoded record. Its synchronous storage/quota limits still apply.
