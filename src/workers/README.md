# Workers-specific runtime APIs

Cloudflare-owned runtime APIs are separate from Web standards and Node modules.
A local module resolving successfully is not proof of full API compatibility.

| API                                     | Local implementation                                | Status / boundary                                                                                                                                               |

| ExecutionContext                        | `src/fetch/runtime.ts`, `src/isolated/transport.ts` | Existing request-runtime behavior; `passThroughOnException` unsupported; no complete API certification                                                          |

ExecutionContext remains owned by request execution rather than being extracted
into a disconnected API stub. The inherited `cloudflare:workers` partial adapter
is completion debt, not a newly completed unit. Do not add empty implementation
folders for unsupported APIs.

Cloud resource bindings and remote dispatch are tracked in
[bindings](../bindings/README.md), independently of local runtime compatibility.
