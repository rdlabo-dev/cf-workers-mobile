# Minvoice native acceptance

[Minvoice](https://github.com/ddyy/minvoice) is a third-party MIT-licensed invoicing application, not an integration template. `upstream.json` pins the application commit; `prepare.mjs` clones it, uses its own lockfile and asserts a clean checkout. No application code, middleware or configuration is rewritten.

The test runs its original Hono entry and SQL migrations in local workerd/D1. It seeds isolated business settings, disables payment/email integrations and uses a test-only password. No production Worker, database, customer, payment or email service is contacted.

The scenario signs in through the original form, creates a client and creates a draft invoice. Assertions check the saved database rows and reject a sandboxed cross-origin form submission. This is not acceptance of payment processors, email delivery, Cloudflare Access, PDF printing or every Minvoice feature.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm ci --prefix demo
npm ci --prefix demo/opennext
node demo/tests/upstream/minvoice/prepare.mjs
node --test demo/tests/upstream/minvoice/browser.test.mjs
UPSTREAM_PLATFORM=ios UPSTREAM_DEVICE=<simulator-udid> node --test demo/tests/upstream/minvoice/native.test.mjs
UPSTREAM_PLATFORM=android UPSTREAM_DEVICE=<emulator-id> node --test demo/tests/upstream/minvoice/native.test.mjs
```

The native tests share the `demo/opennext` platform shell; run tests using that shell serially. Generated files and reports are in `demo/artifacts/upstream/minvoice/`. The test-only HTML driver operates the original forms; it does not replace the application handlers or disable CSRF/authentication.
